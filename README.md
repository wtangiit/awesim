======

awesime is event-driven simulator for data aware distributed workflow system. it is intended to simulate the resource management and scheduling for Shock/AWE (https://github.com/MG-RAST/AWE) data management and workflow system but can be extended to generic distrubted system resource management or even data-aware batch scheduling simulation. The simulator is built based on ROSS discrete-event simulation tool (http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~chrisc/ross.html) and CODES storage/network model package (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/projects/codes/).
